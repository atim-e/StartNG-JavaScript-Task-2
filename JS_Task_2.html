        //Creating an array of objects called data

        let data = []

/* Write a function called "interestCalculator"
that takes an array as a single argument and does the following:
Determine the rate applicable using the conditions:
-If the principal is greater than or equal to 2500 and the time is greater than 1 and less than 3,
then rate = 3
-If the principal is greater than or equal to 2500 and the time is greater than or equal to 3, then rate = 4
-If the principal is less than 2500 or the time is less than or equal to 1, then rate = 2
-Otherwise, rate = 1;} */
        



// Calculate the interest for each individual object using the formula: (principal * rate * time) / 100. 

// The function should return an array of objects called 'interestData' and each individual object should have 'principal', 'rate', 'time' and 'interest' as keys with their corresponding values.


// Log the 'interestData' array to console BEFORE your return statement.

// Finally, call/execute the function and pass the 'data' array you created.
